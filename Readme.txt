4) Ironically, I feel like I only got stuck on the simplest issues. I only had to go
    get help on these 3 simple things, mainly because I just forget the code.

   This one, I literally just used to format the command line argument in
   simulation into an int 
   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-convert-a-string-to-an-int-in-java/
   I forgot how to convert between primitives (again)
   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-double-to-integer-in-java/
   This one just helped me format my print statements nicely
